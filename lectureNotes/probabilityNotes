Probability is one way to quantify outcomes that cannot be predicted with 
uncertanty

Sample Space
    Probabilistic process is the system/experiment which results are uncertain
    Outcome is the output to this process
    Sample Space of a probabilistic process is the set of all possible outcomes  
        of that process
        
Set theory 
    Set is a collection of objects
    Super general
    Set Operations:
        Union: AuB = all elements in both A and B
        Intersection: AnB = All elements A and B share
        Compliment: One set in not two
            You have to define a set of objects under consideration
            A^c = whatever is not in A
    Examples:
        Flipping a coin
            Sample space = either H or T
            |SS| = 2
        Selecting card from deck
            Sample Space = {1,13 * {H, S, D, C}}
            |SS = 52
        Measuring Commute time on a particular morning
            Could be infinite
            Could be short
            Many factors outside of your control
            Sample space = {0, t} where t = Real num
            
            
    
Natural numbers
    |A| = size/num of elements
    N = {0,1,2,3,...}
    |N| = infinity
    
    R - all real numbers
    |R| = infinity
    yet |R| != |N|
    
    Z = integers = {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}
    |Z| = infinity
    
    Q = rational numbers
    C = imaginary part to real numbers
    
    There are different sizes of infinity
